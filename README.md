# Inter-Scalar Coherence Engine (ISC Engine) — v1.2 Frozen Release

The ISC Engine is a hybrid neural–symbolic system for structural coherence evaluation, integrating geometric embeddings (encoder v5), dynamic invariance metrics (engine v4), symbolic domain topology (v6b), and explicit rule-based reasoning (symbolic v2).

Features:
- structural polarity (POS / NEG / NON)  
- invariance metrics: Δκ, DoM-integral, ΔI-reentry, dH/dt, S_sim  
- 12-domain macro-field mapping  
- symbolic rule layer with explainability  
- reproducible CLI/API tools (not included in this public repo)  

Validation:
- KV-3 (20/20 correct — 100%)  
- RW-20 (~90%)  
- RW-40 (87.5%)  

This repository contains:
- public documentation,  
- technical one-pager,  
- architecture overview,  
- high-level results.  

The core engine implementation and datasets are proprietary and **not** included here.
