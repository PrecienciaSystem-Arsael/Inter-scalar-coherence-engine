# Inter-Scalar Coherence Engine (ISC Engine)
## Technical One-Pager — Public Version 1.2

**Engine Type:** Neural–Symbolic Coherence Evaluator  
**External Name:** ISC Engine

## 1. Purpose

ISC Engine provides an independent structural signal for evaluating text.
It does not generate content; it evaluates the *proportional stability* of meaning across transformations.

## 2. High-Level Pipeline (Conceptual)

```
Input Text
   │
   ▼
1. Geometric Encoding
   - embedding representation
   - structural polarity signals
   │
   ▼
2. Dynamic Coherence Assessment
   - proportional consistency
   - directional stability
   - drift indicators
   │
   ▼
3. Domain Mapping
   - assignment to one of 12 high-level structural domains
   │
   ▼
4. Symbolic Pattern Detection
   - explicit rules for proportionality, return, drift, etc.
   │
   ▼
5. Final Coherence Classification
   - POS / NEG / NON
```

This document exposes the conceptual architecture only.
Implementation details, invariants, and label logic remain private.

## 3. What the Engine Reports

- structural polarity (POS / NEG / NON)  
- conceptual domain alignment  
- symbolic pattern indicators  
- coherence score (high-level)  

No internal metrics or equations are exposed in this public version.

## 4. Intended Uses

- verifying consistency of LLM outputs  
- analyzing organizational communication  
- detecting structural inversions  
- supporting reasoning-oriented research  
- editorial and quality-control tools  

---

## 5. Non-Disclosed Components

This repo does **not** include:

- internal invariance metrics  
- embedding transformations  
- symbolic rule implementation  
- label fusion logic  
- prototypes  
- datasets  
- engine code  

All internal mechanisms are proprietary.
