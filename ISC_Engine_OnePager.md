## 1. Problem

LLMs generate text that is extremely fluent but often structurally unstable:
- persuasive but poorly grounded  
- logically inconsistent  
- vulnerable to drift and pseudo-coherence  
- difficult to audit or verify  

Organizations need a **coherence layer** that can evaluate structure independently of semantics.

---

## 2. Solution — ISC Engine

A hybrid neural–symbolic engine that measures **structural coherence** across scales.

The engine produces:
- structural polarity (POS / NEG / NON)  
- coherence score  
- proportionality & drift indicators  
- high-level rule-based flags  
- domain mapping (12 conceptual fields)

It does **not** rely on sentiment, topic, or content.  
It evaluates **structure**.

## 3. Why It’s Different

- **Neural + Symbolic Hybrid**  
  Combines geometric embeddings with explicit reasoning signals.

- **Explainable**  
  Instead of “this feels wrong”, it reports *why*.

- **Model-Agnostic**  
  Can evaluate human text, LLM output, or mixed workflows.

- **Reproducible**  
  v1.2 is frozen and deterministic.

## 4. Applications

- AI safety verification  
- LLM output filtering  
- enterprise communication analysis  
- editorial quality tools  
- research on coherence and reasoning  

---

## 5. Validation (Public Summary)

Test suites demonstrate strong differentiation across:
- coherent / structurally aligned text  
- inversions, pseudo-mechanisms, and simulacra  
- non-anchored / surreal constructions  

Details available on request (private report).

## 6. Next Steps

- API integration  
- dashboard visualization  
- enterprise pilots  
- extended rule ontology  
- encoder v7 research
