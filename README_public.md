## 1. What ISC Engine Is

The Inter-Scalar Coherence Engine (ISC Engine) is a **neural–symbolic evaluation layer** designed to estimate the *structural coherence* of text.

It does **not** generate content.  
It does **not** replace LLMs.  
It provides an **independent structural signal** that can be combined with any model or workflow.

The ISC Engine focuses on detecting:

- internal proportional consistency  
- directional stability (meaning flow)  
- rhetorical drift / simulacra  
- non-anchored or surreal constructions  
- structurally inverted patterns

This makes it suitable for AI safety, enterprise communication analysis, editorial pipelines, and reasoning research.

## 2. What ISC Engine Does (Conceptual Only)

✔ Scores structural coherence  
✔ Maps text into high-level structural domains  
✔ Flags rhetorical patterns (mechanism vs. non-mechanism)  
✔ Provides explainable signals (rule activations)  
✔ Supports POS / NEG / NON high-level labels

This repo describes the concepts only.  
The internal engine architecture is **not published**.

## 3. Why It Matters

Modern AI systems produce text that is fluent but not always structurally grounded.  
ISC Engine provides an *independent proportionality signal* that can be used to:

- filter LLM outputs  
- detect internal inconsistencies  
- identify rhetorical drift  
- assess stability across paraphrases or transformations

## 4. Use Cases

- **AI Safety** — detecting reasoning drift, chain-of-thought instability  
- **Enterprise Messaging** — flagging overpromising or simulacra patterns  
- **Editorial Tools** — identifying structurally weak passages  
- **Research** — studying coherence beyond semantics
